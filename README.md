# machine_learning_algorithm_in_python
is a repository that will have machine learning algorithm writen in python using numpy, pandas.

We will use the style of **sklearn** writing the algorithms
### Current algorithm
* multivariate linear regression
* binary logistic regression 
* multi-class logistic regression (softmax)
### Algorithm evaluation
In the end We will compare between sklearn algorithm and the written one.
